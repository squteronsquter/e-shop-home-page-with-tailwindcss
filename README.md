# Tailwind CSS for e-Commerce Project

Remember that in the tailwind tutorial the index.html file is in the src folder

In this project index.html file is in the root and the css file is in the /src folder, that's why tailwind.config.js is more specific than the general directive to look for files in the example shown in TailwindCSS docs.

## To run this project

cd into the project directory and install all packages

```
npm i
```

Create css code in the dist director

```
npm run dev
```

Use Live Server to view your website in development mode

_Happy coding_
