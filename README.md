# Tailwind CSS for e-Commerce Project

Remember that in the tailwind tutorial the index.html file is in the src folder

In this project index.html file is in the root and the css file is in the /src folder, that's why tailwind.config.js is more specific than the general directive to look for files in the example shown in TailwindCSS docs.
